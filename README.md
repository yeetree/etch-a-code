#### The semi-permanant IDE!

### What is Etch-A-Code?
Etch-a-code is an IDE based off of an Etch-A-Sketch! It's like any other IDE, but with a few catches,
When you type a character or go to a new line, you can't go back. If you want to change something, you have to clear the whole thing! Like an Etch-A-Sketch!

If you want to, you can save your code by exporting it. However, you cannot import code. (please do not write a code-importer that just types it all in, that would be cheating!!!)

Like other IDEs, you can run code in it too!
Click on the "Run" button at the top, select your language, and it's good to go!
Currently, we have full support for BrainF**k, and semi-support for JavaScript.
